## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was built to analyze a pizza company's sales data. It uncovers which pizzas are the most and least popular, when customers are most likely to order, and what size and flavor categories are preferred. It supports smarter business decisions based on clear visual insights.

## 📄 Description
A pizza company wanted to better understand customer preferences and improve business decisions using sales data. This dashboard brings their data to life revealing key patterns across products, time, and customer choices.

## ❓ Problem Statement
The business lacked visibility into:
📍 Which pizzas perform best or worst

📍Customer preferences for pizza sizes and flavors

📍The best days and months for sales

📍Performance comparisons across categories (e.g., Veggie vs Chicken)

This made it difficult to plan production, pricing, staffing, and promotions.


## 🎯 Objective
1️⃣ Identify top and bottom-selling pizzas

2️⃣ Analyze sales by pizza **category** and **size**

3️⃣ Discover best-performing **days** and **months**

4️⃣ Support business decisions through easy-to-understand visuals
